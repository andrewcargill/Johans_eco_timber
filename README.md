## Presentation of the project

## Overview of the development journey
Before I begin documenting this projects development I wanted to highlight that this project really did help me understand the effectiveness of 'agile' and that my original planning proposed the creation of a two database system  - but early into development I understood that this was not going to work and so I privotted the project and created a really great solution. I will document this later within my documentation. But I felt it important to make the reader away.
