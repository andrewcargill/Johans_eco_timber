### Presentation of the project
Custom Timber Co. is a small company up in the north of Sweden that specialise in custom milled timber, owned by Johan, a guy who is passionate about the nature and the environment. This website is connecting Johan to his customers and helping communication in a modern and effective way.

### Overview of the development journey
Before I begin documenting this projects development I wanted to highlight that this project really did help me understand the effectiveness of 'agile' and that my original planning proposed the creation of a two database system  - but early into development I understood that this was not going to work and so I privotted the project and created a really great solution. I will document this later within my documentation. But I felt it important to make the reader away.

### The company
This is based on a real-life company in the North of Sweden. For these small sawmills it is currently hard for them to connect with customers, without having a custom made website and backend. Often enquires and communications are done via Facebook or some-kind of primitive local online market place. 

### Research
Much research was carried out. I visited the sawmill and spoke with the owner about his needs and desires.

### Customer Interviews
I spoke with several people who worked made custom wood products, that I know would need to buy timber. 

### Video Proposal
Here is my mock proposal video, which I used to shape up the project before starting development. 

### Wireframes
My original wireframes for the project look a little different to the finished project. These evolved as the project progressed. 

### Planning & Design
My original plan was to use two databases but this was later simplified to one database linked to the users primary key.

### User Stories
I generated over 100 user stories in developing this project. I made use of the 'project' feature within GitHub to manage the ordering and completion. 

### Story Points & Sprints
My allocation and valuing of story points moved a little as the project progressed. I completed my first sprint and re-assessed the value of 1 story point - After the first week of development I was confident on the value of one story point. For me this was a User Story that I knew how to complete and required little background research. 

Sprint lengths changed depending on my work/ study hours for that day or week of production. This would be much easier with a standard 40hr week, but I did feel that it was useful to apply sprints to my work even when working alone and studying as I do, as it helped me set goals for sections of the projects development.

### Epics into User Stories
I have two examples of where I have set epics and then broken them down into User Stories. 
- Final design
- Documentation

### The Timeline (Document)
I have put together a small time line to document the progress of the project from start to end. This highlights my sprints and allocation of story points etc.
