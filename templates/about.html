                    <h5>My Background</h5>
                    <p>
                        I brought a forest and then studied wood and metal work at Vindeln College. This is
                        where my passion for the nature and sustainable forestry began. As my forest is only
                         30 hectares and close to the main farm I am able to work in a small scale without the
                          need for large equipment.</p>
                        <p> I brought the sawmill for my own timber projects and then quickly realised that I
                        produced more timber than I needed.</p>

                        <h5>Other interests</h5>
                        <p>I love making music and playing guitar! Of course being out in the nature is fun too.
                            I have girls with a big interest in horses, so this takes up a lot of the free time.
                            But most of all, chatting with friends and customers about their next amazing wood project!
