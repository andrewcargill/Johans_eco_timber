                    <p>
                        The forest is rougly 100 acres. The forest soil is sand-based meaning that it is ideal for Pine
                        and spruce.
                        Tree age ranges throughout the forest, but we have access to trees as old as 100 years.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Managing the forest</h5>
                    <p>Selective cut forestry is our method of choice as it allows the nature to remain unharmed and
                        encourages the forest to become mixed-age and mixed species over time. Around 40 percent of the
                        trees we mill are wind-fallen (Trees that fell due to high-winds).
                    </p>
                    <p>We only use small machines to remove the trees and every tree we take down is selected and felled
                        by hand.</p>
